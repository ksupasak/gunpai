#   enabled: true
#   # Optional: The threshold passed to cv2.threshold to determine if a pixel is different enough to be counted as motion. (default: shown below)
#   # Increasing this value will make motion detection less sensitive and decreasing it will make motion detection more sensitive.
#   # The value should be between 1 and 255.
#   threshold: 30
#   # Optional: The percentage of the image used to detect lightning or other substantial changes where motion detection
#   #           needs to recalibrate. (default: shown below)
#   # Increasing this value will make motion detection more likely to consider lightning or ir mode changes as valid motion.
#   # Decreasing this value will make motion detection more likely to ignore large amounts of motion such as a person approaching
#   # a doorbell camera.
#   lightning_threshold: 0.8
#   # Optional: Minimum size in pixels in the resized motion image that counts as motion (default: shown below)
#   # Increasing this value will prevent smaller areas of motion from being detected. Decreasing will
#   # make motion detection more sensitive to smaller moving objects.
#   # As a rule of thumb:
#   #  - 10 - high sensitivity
#   #  - 30 - medium sensitivity
#   #  - 50 - low sensitivity
#   contour_area: 10
#   # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging frames to determine the background (default: shown below)
#   # Higher values mean the current frame impacts the average a lot, and a new object will be averaged into the background faster.
#   # Low values will cause things like moving shadows to be detected as motion for longer.

#   frame_alpha: 0.01
#   # Optional: Height of the resized motion frame  (default: 100)

#   # Lower values result in less CPU, but small changes may not register as motion.
#   frame_height: 100

#   # Enables dynamic contrast improvement. This should help improve night detections at the cost of making motion detection more sensitive
#   # for daytime.

    days: 0
    # Optional: Mode for retention. Available options are: all, motion, and active_objects
    #   all - save all recording segments regardless of activity

  # Optional: Recording Export Settings

    # Optional: Timelapse Output Args (default: shown below).
    # NOTE: The default args are set to fit 24 hours of recording into 1 hour playback.
    # See https://stackoverflow.com/a/58268695 for more info on how these args work.
    # As an example: if you wanted to go from 24 hours to 30 minutes that would be going
    # from 86400 seconds to 1800 seconds which would be 1800 / 86400 = 0.02.
    # The -r (framerate) dictates how smooth the output video is.
    # So the args would be -vf setpts=0.02*PTS -r 30 in that case.
    timelapse_args: "-vf setpts=0.04*PTS -r 30"

      #
      # NOTE: If the retain mode for the camera is more restrictive than the mode configured
      #       here, the segments will already be gone by the time this mode is applied.
      #       For example, if the camera retain mode is "motion", the segments without motion are
      #       never stored, so setting the mode to "all" here won't bring them back.
